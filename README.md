# Microcontroller RP 2040
The RP 2040 microcontroller developed by the Raspberry Foundation offers a variety of possible applications in the hobby sector.

The displays from Waveshare, but also the Pico-Boy and the RP2040 Pico-Geek are particularly interesting. They can all be operated excellently with the firmware 'CircuitPython'. But unfortunately for hobby programmers there are usually only instructions in 'Micro Python'. In contrast, CircuitPython offers many libraries from Adafruit that make it easier to access demanding applications. The purpose of the following instructions is to show this.

On my website I also show you a lot of possible applications, always with detailed instructions on how to do them.
