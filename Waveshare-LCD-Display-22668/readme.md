# Waveshare LCD Display 22668
## 1.28" Round IPS LCD Display - Waveshare 22668 
## with 6 axis ACC/Gyroscope sensor (CircuitPython Guide)

The round LCD display with motion sensor is perfect for watch applications. At first I show you one variant with a
digital time display. Instead of analog clock-hands, a second dot (white), a minute dot (green) and a hour dot
(red) moves on the outer circle of the display.
